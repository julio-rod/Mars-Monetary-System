# Mars-Monetary-System
# Background
This system introduces a new cryptocurrency named KaseiCoin ("Kasei" means "Mars" in Japanese).
- KaseiCoin is an ERC-20 compliant fungible token, and a crowdsale will be launched for individauls moving to Mars to convert their earth currency to KaseiCoin. 
# Project Overview
This project involves the creation of an ERC-20 compliant fungible token, KaseiCoin, minted using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZepplin Solidity library. The crowdsale contract manages the entire process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and receive KaseiCoin tokens (KSC) in return. 
# Features 
- KaseiCoin Token Contract: ERC-20 compliant fungible token.
- KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract: Manages the crowdsale process.
- KaseiCoin Deployer Contract: Handles the deployment of the other two contracts. 
# Development and Testing
The contracts were tested on a local blockchain using Remix, Metamask, and Ganache. 
# Deployment
----------
## Deploy the Crowdsale to a Local Blockchain
1. Deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain with Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.
2. Test the functionality of the crowdsale using test accounts to buy new tokens and check balances associated with those accounts.
3. After purchasing tokens, view the total supply of minted tokens and the amount of wei raised in the crowdsale contract.
